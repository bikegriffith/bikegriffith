### Hi there 👋

- 😄 I work on the Design Team as an Engineer @ <a href="https://www.stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a>.
- 🔐 Though I'm still developing every day, you probably won't see me as much on github.com anymore 🥹
- 🔭 I love tinkering with all things on the web, embedded devices, and anything that goes fast (code, rockets, RC, bicycles, you name it)
- 📫 Reach me via email, bikegriffith@gmail.com
